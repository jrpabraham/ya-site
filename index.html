					<p>David and Leyanne first crossed paths in April 2017. David had a crush on Leyanne but it wasn't until January 2019 that the spark between them ignited into a flame of romance.</p>

					<div class="fleuron"><img alt = "fleuron" src="assets/fernicon.png"></div>

					<p>David and Leyanne have since shared countless moments of joy, laughter, and adventure. From exploring new destinations to trying different foods at new restaurants, each experience added to their love story. Through the ups and downs, navigating the challenges of a global pandemic and conquering the trials of a long-distance relationship while David pursued a master's degree in Florida, their love only grew stronger.</p>

					<div class="fleuron"><img alt = "fleuron" src="assets/fernicon.png"></div>

					<p>In November 2023, David asked Leyanne to be his forever and, with tears of joy and hearts full of love, they embraced the next chapter of their story&mdash;an engagement that marked the beginning of a lifetime together. David and Leyanne will continue to grow in love as they aspire to travel the world, experience new adventures, and chase their dreams together.</p>
